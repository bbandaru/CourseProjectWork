Feature Selection 
=================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the data captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 



The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 



These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

The dataset INPUT includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 



The dataset OUTPUT includes the tidyData table :
=========================================
Output data contains 4 variables as: subjectid, activity , measurement and average. 
The output tidy data file contains the full set of the activities data carried out by both test and train subjects (1:30) for all the activities identified as (original value of 1: 6 as) :


- 'WALKING', 

- 'WALKING_UPSTAIRS'.

- 'WALKING-DOWNSTAIRS',

- 'SITTING', 

- 'STANDING'.

- 'LAYING',

Hence the out put data Tidy Data contains:

Columns 1 = 'subjectid' refers to the id of the subject and range is 1 to 30 and the column 2 is 'activity' and refers to the activity performed by each subject and the activity  variable provide the lable for each activity and the values are up to 6 activities :

- 'WALKING', 

- 'WALKING_UPSTAIRS'.

- 'WALKING-DOWNSTAIRS',

- 'SITTING', 

- 'STANDING'.

- 'LAYING',

the third column /variable refers to the measurement the variable of the measurement. The value has upto 66 values as provided below:

The fouth coulmn represents the average value of each measurement and the value is normalised and varry from -1 to +1 

All the data is separated by ",".

the out put tezxt file is called tidyData.txt.
